      William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet,
      painter, and <br />
      printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered
      a seminal figure in <br />
      the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he
      called his "prophetic works" <br />
      were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in
      proportion to its merits <br />
      the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His htm java

      Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
      Britons.[4] While he lived in London <br />
      his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a
      diverse and symbolically rich<br />
      collection of works, which embraced the imagination as "the body of
      God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]

      Although Blake was considered mad<br />
      by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high
      regard<br />
      by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the<br />
      philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings<br />
      and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and
      as<br />
      "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been said to be "a key early
      proponent<br />
      of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was<br />
      hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of
      organised<br />
      religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the
      French<br />
      and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many of
      these<br />
      political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the<br />
      political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers
      such<br />
      as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the
      singularity<br />
      of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century
      scholar<br />
      William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a "glorious
      luminary",[13]<br />
      and "a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with<br />
      contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable<br />
      successors".[14]
